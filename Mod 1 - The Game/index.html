    <h2>Description of the game:</h2>
    </div>

    <li>This will be a very simple game to understand, but a very hard game to master.</li>
    <li>The reasoning behind that statement is that it is a game based partly on luck and partly on skill.</li>
    <li>So finally, what is this game. Well, it's a race, of sorts.</li>
    <li>You will be racing against one other player with the stocks that you both individiually pick.</li>
    
    <div id="rules">
    <h3>So, how do you play:</h3>
    </div>

    <ol>
        <li>The first rule of the game is to pick a stock from the stock market. Your range of selection consists only of stocks, not ETF's, options, index funds, etc.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>This is to add dynamism and excitement through volitity.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>The second rule of the game is to select a specific time in which the game will finish. This can be 10 mins or 30 mins or longer. </li>
        <li>
            The third rule of the game is to play. Whether you win or have fun isn't really up to me. But, winning is done simply by outperforming your competitor... having fun is a bit more complicated.
        </li>
        <li>During this stage of the game, the stocks that both players picked will be tracked and displayed on your screens, and whomever's stock outperforms the other's during the alocated time, wins.</li>
    <li>In other words, you will both be racing with stocks are your vehicles to the finish line.</li>
    </ol>
