    <h2>Description of the game:</h2>
    </div>

    <li>This will be a very simple game to understand, but a very hard game to master.</li>
    <li>The reasoning behind that statement is that it is a game based partly on luck and partly on skill.</li>
    <li>So finally, what is this game. Well, it's, a game where you'll have to use intuition, years of experience. A game where you will have to put blood, sweat, and tears into to see the reults you want.</li>
    <li>Alright, alright, it's a game where you compete against one other person to pick the stock worth the most. BUT NO GOOGLING...only Bing...</li>
    
    <div id="rules">
    <h3>So, how do you play:</h3>
    </div>

    <ol>
        <li>The first rule of the game is to pick a stock from the stock market. Your range of selection consists only of stocks, not ETF's, options, index funds, etc.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>This is to add dynamism and excitement through volitity... well, depending on your stock.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>The second rule of the game is to conjure up all of those years in your finance classes, or news watching so you're able to select not just any stock, but the stock with the highest price per share.  </li>
        <li>
            The third rule of the game is to play. Whether you win or have fun isn't really up to me. But, winning is done simply by outperforming your competitor... having fun is a bit more complicated.
        </li>
        <li>During this stage of the game, one player will press the "Check the Price" button. Then, the the current, live price of stocks that both players picked will be displayed on your screens, and whomever's stock has a higher price will win!</li>
    <li>In other words, goodluck...also, keep in mind that it's live, so just because it had one price during one round doesn't guarantee it will be the same price the next round.</li>
    </ol>
