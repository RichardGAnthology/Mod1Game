Hi!
This is a game that's fetching live data from a stockmarket thanks to twelvedata.com

The point of this game is in part, to inform those who play about how much it would cost to invest in some of the most well known companies, companies like Amazon and Pepsi.

It's a game where you two players face-off against eachother in a stake-free environment.
After two won rounds, a winner will be selected. The beauty of this program, is that because it is live, one particular stock won't always be the best stock to win.

Hope you all enjoy!
