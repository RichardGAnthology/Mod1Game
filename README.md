# Mod1Game (WORK-IN-PROGRESS)

Hi!
This is a game that's fetching live data from a stock market thanks to twelvedata.com.

The point of this game is in part, to inform those who play about how much it would cost to invest in some of the most well known companies, companies like Amazon and Pepsi.

It's a game where you two players face-off against each other in a stake-free environment.
After two won rounds, a winner will be selected. The beauty of this program, is that because it is live, one particular stock won't always be the best stock to win.

Technologies used include but are not limited to: HTML, CSS, Javascript.

Hope you all enjoy!
